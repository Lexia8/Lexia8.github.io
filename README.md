## Websites I recommend 
* [Wikipedia] (www.wikipedia.org) -  _Wikipedia_ is a free, user-edited encyclopedia where anyone can add or change info on pretty much any topic. It is useful for quick info, but since  anyone can edit it, sometimes thereâ€™s misinformation. But for the most part it is usually pretty accurate thanks to people fact-checking each other.
* [Comptia] (www.comptia.org) - _Comptia_ is a very useful website when you are trying to get certifications or knowledge to break into Tech.
